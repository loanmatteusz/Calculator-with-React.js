## A Calculator maked with React.js

This project was created using React.js with typescript model, where I could learn the use of the following technologies:

- `The use of Application's State using useState method of the React`
- `Use of the Application's Props`

In addition, the main thing was to do all this using functional programming. Will be great resource to my skills as frontend developer. :smile: :heart: :star2:
